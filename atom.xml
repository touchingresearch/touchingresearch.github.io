It was part of the <a href="http://todaysart.nl/2015/symposium/hack-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="external">2015 TodaysArt festival</a>, specifically the Bright Collisions Symposium. I prepared a short presentation, but ended up using the material mostly for discussions with the group. The meeting brought together scientists, artists, engineers and product developers to discuss topics related to biometric synchronization: “Can two or more people synchronize their biometric signals (heart beat, respiration, gsr-sweat) with each other? Can synchrony of these signals be induced? What measure of synchrony can be established? How can synchrony be represented, modeled within the environment, and used as a catalyst for feedback? What hardware can we use to measure biometric sensing and feedback such as ECG, EEG, GSR?” </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 3rd of July, I participated in the <a href="https://www.3tu.nl/ht/en/news/first-dutch-sat-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="external">1st meeting on the study of social and affective touch in the Netherlands</a>. The main goal of the meeting was to explore possibilities and interests of Dutch scientists, tech people and artists who are involved in this topic to collaborate and regularly come together. We could then share ideas, insights, equipment etc. It was very inspiring to meet people from different disciplines who share a similar interest. For instance, in their art project <a href="http://www.lancelmaat.nl/work/e.e.g-kiss/" target="_blank" rel="external">E.E.G. KISS</a>, artists Karen Lancel and Herman Maat of TU Delft use ultra-portable EEG headsets to measure the brain activity of romantic partners while they are kissing, hugging and touching each other. I presented some of my recent findings on the soothing effects of soft materials, especially for insecurely attached individuals. My sister (and soon-to-be industrial engineer specialized in Design for Interaction), Viola Tjew-A-Sin, was also invited to the meeting. Her <a href="http://studenten.tudelft.nl/nl/informatie/faculteitspecifiek/industrieel-ontwerpen/agenda/event/detail/graduate-viola-tjew-a-sin-dfi/" target="_blank" rel="external">graduation project is about mediated social touch</a>, specifically the aspect of warmth, and how it may be used to increase empathy and connectedness between people with alexithymia and their loved ones.  </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past week, I had the pleasure of taking part in a one-week <a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2015/688/info.php3?wsid=688" target="_blank" rel="external">NIAS-Lorentz workshop on “Social support TAT: Theory, Applications, and Technology”</a> that aimed to bring together different (e.g., biological, clinical, neurological and psychological perspectives) on social support. The workshop also mixed scientific talks with hardware and software development by inviting people from both the scientific and the tech community. I very much enjoyed both elements of the workshop. Based on my poster abstract, I was invited to give a one hour talk on my research on touch and existential concerns, for which I also received a Best Paper award (also on behalf of my co-authors). For my presentation, I worked in findings from my newer line of research on loneliness and mental health (see abstract below). All in all, it’s been a very interesting and exciting week.</p>
<p>“Loneliness Moderates the Association Between Vulnerable Personality and Mental Health</p>
<p>A number of personality traits – such as low self-esteem, high neuroticism, high thought suppression, and high alexithymia- appear to reflect latent vulnerabilities, in that these traits are consistently predictive of poor mental health. However, not all people with vulnerable personality traits display poor mental health, suggesting that there might be moderating variables that determine whether these people’s latent vulnerability becomes translated into overt psychological complaints. In our research, we examined whether loneliness is one such moderating variable. Because people have an innate need for social connections with others, we suggest that loneliness is a critical circumstance that leads to deteriorations in mental health among people with vulnerable personality traits. I will present five studies, including three cross-sectional studies, one longitudinal study, and one experimental study, that support this line of reasoning. Taken together, these findings suggest that loneliness is a catalyst for the development of mental health problems among people with latent vulnerabilities in their personality functioning.”  </p>

Current and future directions in Terror Management Theory’. This was my first time presenting for an international audience at a big social psychology conference. It went very smoothly. I really enjoyed it, especially talking to people afterwards. You could tell that the people who showed up were really interested in either touch and/or research on existential psychology. I really liked the conference in general. It was very open and inclusive to everyone. I met some very nice people, enjoyed exploring Amsterdam and got to try out the Google Glass.</p>

This biennial conference is held at a large conference center in Zeist, surrounded by nature. On the morning of the second day, I got up early and enjoyed a very pleasant walk in the woods before joining the sessions again. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the institute, everyone received a book showing the history and achievements of the institute and short interviews with all KLI alumni. It’s very interesting to read about the career paths that people took after getting their PhD.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was selected (on a competitive basis) to participate in a very interesting, interdisciplinary summer school on the island of Aegina, Greece, on embodied intersubjectivity. They invited around 50 PhD students, post-docs, and other (mostly) young researchers and of course a large number of people to teach us. The presentations were given by leading researchers from the fields of experimental,developmental and social psychology, cognitive and social neuroscience, anthropology, primatology and philosophy. The programme included sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st person perspectives of embodiment</li>
<li>The embodied self in interaction with the world</li>
<li>Ontogenetic and phylogenetic perspectives on social cognition</li>
<li>Transition from 3rd person- to 2nd person perspective in social neuroscience</li>
<li>Embodying other people’s minds and bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a very nice week with many interesting lectures, kind people, a beautiful location and great food. During the week, I also gave a short presentation on my work on touch and existential concerns, and I presented a poster afterwards on the same topic. Before I left Greece, I was able to sneak a very nice visit to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum.</p>

This was my first time working on an article that had to be accessible to a broach audience. We had to revise it quite a few times, but it was an exciting challenge. The title and intro of the paper are shown below:</p>
<p>“That human touch that means so much: Exploring the tactile dimension of social life</p>
<p>Interpersonal touch is a fundamental but undervalued aspect of human nature. In the present article, the authors review psychological research showing that even fleeting forms of touch may have a powerful impact on our emotional and social functioning. Given its significant beneficial effects, touch may be valuable as a therapeutic or health-promoting tool.”</p>

This is my first week as a PhD Student, and my first meeting with the other lab members, so this is quite the start! The lab group will mainly research embodied emotion regulation, and is funded by an ERC grant that was awarded to Sander Koole last year. We will be working at the Clinical Psychology department at the VU. The conference was very interesting and unique with more exploratory as well as very experimental and data-heavy talks. I liked how casual the conference was, with informal dress code, lots of students and a surprising focus on meditation and dance. Sander gave a short but sweet presentation about our research on touch and existential concerns.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a huge effort from Sander Koole (my internship supervisor) and I in the past half year or so, I recently <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2012/Moza%C3%AFek-toekenningen+bij+MaGW.html" target="_blank" rel="external">received the Mosaic grant</a> from the NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research). In January this year, I found out through a fellow student that I was eligible for this grant, but we only had a few weeks until the application deadline which included a detailed grant proposal. We had to work hard and fast to make the deadline. After making the first selection phase (41 out of 210) in February, I followed workshops to further develop my research ideas and to prepare a presentation to convince a multidisciplinary committee of professors to fund the project.</p>
<p>This summer, during my vacation, I was informed that I was one of 20 to receive the grant. Not long after, near the end of the year, NWO also held a short ceremony to award the grants in person. This was also the last time that the grant was awarded because of budget cuts, which does make it extra special. Even without applying for this grant, the last year at the VU has been a huge learning experience for me, and also very challenging, but I am very grateful that these efforts have been rewarded. It is the cherry on the cake. This is a short summary of the research project:</p>
<p>“The proposed research investigates how and why affirming feelings of belonging may improve academic achievement among ethnic minority students. The resulting insights will be used to design powerful new belongingness interventions. These interventions will be evaluated in terms of their effectiveness in closing the minority achievement gap.”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been testing participants for an EEG study on the effects of simulated interpersonal touch on a neural marker of error processing: the error-related negativity. I am slowly getting a knack for preparing participants for each recording. I learned of all the possible ways an EEG recording may be distorted, and the care that goes into obtaining clean interpretable data. Also, many technical problems needed to be solved and it was a challenge to deal with them and to liaise with the technical staff about these matters. Dr Koole found two psychology graduates who assisted me with the data collection. It was fun to instruct them all that I had learned during the past weeks.</p>
<p>After testing the last participants the previous week, two researchers from another research group started using the laboratory and equipment. Because they had no previous experience with EEG research, I was asked to instruct them on the workings of the lab and how to prepare participants. Again, it was nice to transfer the skills and knowledge I had learned to other people new to the technique. Soon after, I followed a brief one-day tutorial given by Dr Heslenfeld on how to analyze the EEG data using Neuroscan. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The research that I’m working on with Sander Koole at the VU University has found its way into the Dutch magazine Intermediair. It is an issue on ‘troost’, which is Dutch for ‘comfort’. In our research we find that interpersonal touch, but also touching soft stuffed animals, can be very comforting for people with low self-esteem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In November, I took part in a two-day international expert meeting in Tilburg on the psychological significance of meaning and other existential research topics. Dr Koole presented some of my findings on touch and existential concerns. This was a significant learning experience, and a very inspiring event to have been a part of. I came to know about so many lines of interesting research and so many new ideas. It cemented my desire to become a psychological researcher.</p>
