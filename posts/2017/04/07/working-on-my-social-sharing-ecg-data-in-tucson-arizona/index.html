      <p>It’s been a while since I’ve updated. I’m currently in Tucson, Arizona! I arrived about a week ago, and had a short overlay at JFK airport. I’m staying at a great loft apartment that has all the essentials as well as modern conveniences (like an insinkerator!) that you can imagine. I can walk (or bike) to the University of Arizona in about 25 minutes. The campus is big and impressive, and the people are relaxed and friendly. I went to the UofA to check in and I’ve met up with the Professor that I’m visiting. <a href="https://cals.arizona.edu/fcs/faculty/emily_butler" target="_blank" rel="external">Prof. Emily Butler</a> is very friendly, welcoming and easy to talk to. She’s also working on very exciting developments on <a href="http://compties.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">(the modeling of) emotional co-regulation</a>. This is the main reason I’m in Tucson, and I’ve spent the last week working on and prepping the heart rate data I collected in Tuebingen, Germany. It’s not without its’ challenges, but I’m making progress. The big Goal is to try and analyse and understand this data, and perhaps to collaborate on a paper together. I’ll be in Tucson until May 16th, after which I’ll have a short, hopefully well-deserved, vacation with my partner’s family in Upper Sandusky, Ohio.</p>
