      <p>A month ago, I received an e-mail about the <a href="https://ixa.amsia.nl/amsia-2017/" target="_blank" rel="external">Amsterdam Science and Innovation Award</a> of which the grand finale is held at my university, the VU. It piqued my interest immediately. I decided to involve my sister, Viola, <a href="https://violatjew.nl/" target="_blank" rel="external">who is a talented industrial design engineer with a focus on user-centered design and a big interest in psychology</a>. Together, we brainstormed about different applications of my specific research expertise on solving societal issues, and also about research ideas that could be incorporated in a commercial product. After a month of frequent meet-ups, we ran with the latest version of our idea and entered the competition. There was very little time for further fine-tuning, so we hope to have captured the gist of our (pretty cool) idea. Here’s a short summary we wrote for the competition:</p>
<p>“Modern people lead increasingly rapid and emotionally stressful lives, which accelerate our nervous systems (i.e., breathing quickens and heart rate goes up). At the end of a demanding day, our breathing rate and heart rate are supposed to slow down again in preparation for restful sleep. However, a lot of people become stuck in challenge mode, and find it difficult to reset to a restful bodily state.</p>
<p>We designed an ambient, calming breathing companion called Respiro (latin: I breathe anew). Respiro first uses wireless, contactless sensing technology to continuously monitor a user’s breathing rate and heart rate via detection of chest movement. Secondly, Respiro uses the extracted bodily signals to continuously visually mimic the breathing pattern at a pace slower than the user. Respiro’s personalized breathing pattern calms its user by relying on people’s natural tendencies to synchronize their automatic functions with an external rhythm (or ‘oscillation’). This dynamic process is called ‘entrainment’. Respiro can also mimic the breathing pattern audially or simply provide soft tactile feedback through its ‘breathing’.</p>
<p>Respiro is part of an innovative, exciting, approach to calming tech that is always tailored to the individual to maximize effectiveness, contrasting with the one-size-fits-all approach commonly found in the industry.”</p>
