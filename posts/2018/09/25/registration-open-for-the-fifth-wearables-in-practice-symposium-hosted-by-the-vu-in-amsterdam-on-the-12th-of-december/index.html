<p>We are happy to announce the <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IRglJKHBkym3vbVRS6QvzGEPNIZKkIYp/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">program of the 5th Wearables in Practice Symposium</a></strong>, which will be held at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Previous editions were held at <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/events/2018/wearables-in-practice-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TNO Soesterberg</a> and the <a href="https://www.4tu.nl/ht/en/news/!/225499/new-wearable-in-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Twente</a>. Wearables In Practice is a growing network of scientists, developers and users of wearable biosensors, including people who work in care, forensics and the safety domain, and scientists from affective computing and health/clinical disciplines. A variety of professionals were found willing to contribute to our program. Two of our speakers will give keynote lectures, Mark Hoogendoorn from the department of Artificial Intelligence at the VU will talk about Machine Learning and sensory data, and Hans Bussmann of the Erasmus Medical Center will talk about wearable sensors applied to the rehabilitation of patients.</p>
<p>During the lunch, there is the possibility to present a poster or to show a short demo. You will have the opportunity to ask questions, and to exchange information and ideas. After the lunch break, you may choose one of the two hands-on workshops: one will be about the <a href="http://www.vu-ams.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VU-AMS ambulatory monitoring system</a> for measuring Autonomic Nervous System Activity, including ECG, ICG and skin conductance, and the other will be about providing HR feedback using the Sense-IT platform by the University of Twente. We hope it will be an informative and inspiring day for all attendees.</p>
<p>The presentations start at 10, and end at 16:30, but you are welcome to stay for drinks and snacks until 18:00.</p>
