      <p>I recently finished a very good 3-day course organized by <a href="http://www.pcdi.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PCDI</a> called Employability Outside Academia. Itâ€™s a course for Postdocs and PhDs that is given in small groups and led by an experienced coach. Although it is focused on helping early career researchers make the transition out of academia (and into industry for example), the course is also for researchers who want to figure out whether they want to stay. During the course, there is a lot of focus on personal interests, competencies, skill gaps, talents and ambitions. There are plenty of practical exercises and resources that help you discover them. At the end of the course you end up with about 60 pages of personal insights to help you design your career to your liking and lots to think about. I highly recommend the course, especially if you started your PhD at a young age/fresh out of university.</p>
