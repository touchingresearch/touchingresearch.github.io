      <p>We attended a conference on ‘The implications of embodiment: enactive, clinical, social’ as a lab group. This is my first week as a PhD Student, and my first meeting with the other lab members, so this is quite the start! The lab group will mainly research embodied emotion regulation, and is funded by an ERC grant that was awarded to Sander Koole last year. We will be working at the Clinical Psychology department at the VU. The conference was very interesting and unique with more exploratory as well as very experimental and data-heavy talks. I liked how casual the conference was, with informal dress code, lots of students and a surprising focus on meditation and dance. Sander gave a short but sweet presentation about our research on touch and existential concerns.</p>
