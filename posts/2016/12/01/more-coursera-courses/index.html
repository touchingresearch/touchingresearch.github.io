      <p>Happy to report that I’ve finished the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences" target="_blank" rel="external">‘Improving Your Statistical Inferences’</a> course on Coursera. I think I was five weeks behind on the assignments at some point, but I managed to find some free time to catch up and then power through the rest of the course (had to finish the hyperscanning set-up first). The course included a short preregistration assignment using the <a href="https://osf.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Open Science Framework</a>. I’ve wondered for a while now how much work it would be to preregister a study, so it was nice to go through a short version of that process. It’s not time-consuming at all once you get the hang of it. I highly recommend the course.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it also piqued my interest in Bayesian statistics, so I signed up right away for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics" target="_blank" rel="external">‘Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis’</a>, which was very well-rated on Coursera. It doesn’t start until mid-December, so in the meantime I’ll try to learn some MATLAB basics, as I’m pretty sure that’s what I’ll need to analyse the NIRS data. I’ll be trying out the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab" target="_blank" rel="external">‘Introduction to Programming with MATLAB’</a> course, and will hopefully post an update about my progress before the end of this year.</p>
