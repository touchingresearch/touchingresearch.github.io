      <p>It’s already been a week since I’ve started working at the University of Tübingen, at the <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en/Patients/Hospitals/Psychiatry+and+Psychotherapy/General+Psychiatry+and+Psychotherapy/Research/Psychophysiology+_+Optical+Imaging.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Psychophysiology &amp; Optical Imaging research group</a> led by Dr. Ann-Christine Ehlis. The group is located in the Universitätsklinikum Tübingen for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. It’s a much larger group than the one I’m part of at the Vrije Universiteit, but the topics researched here seem more cohesive. The group mainly focuses on neuro-imaging and other physiological measurements among patients with mental disorders, as well as among healthy (mostly student) volunteers. In the coming months, I’ll be setting up and running a hyperscanning study using near-infrared spectroscopy among close friends/dyads during a social sharing task. I just recently received keys and an employee card from the University and was assigned a room to work in today. So I’m still at the start of the project, but my impressions are very positive, and I’m getting more and more excited about learning some new techniques and skills at this lab group. Plus, Tübingen isn’t a bad looking place to work for a couple months. Not bad at all…</p>
