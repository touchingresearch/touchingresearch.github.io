I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a dual Research Master’s degree in Social & Organisational Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at Leiden University, The Netherlands. I’m currently working towards a PhD at the Clinical, Neuro- and Developmental Psychology Department at the [VU University in Amsterdam](http://vu.nl/en/index.asp). In this department, I am part of the [Amsterdam Emotion Regulation Lab](http://emotionregulationlab.com). Specifically, my research concerns topics such as loneliness, mental health, vulnerability and existential concerns. You can read more about my work on the [Research](http://touchingresearch.com/research/) page.
