I have a Master’s degree in both Social & Organisational Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, and currently work at the Clinical, Neuro- en Developmental Psychology Department at the VU University, The Netherlands. I have an interest in all three fields that make up my department. After all, early childhood experiences build the brain architecture that forms the foundation for health and well-being. Thus, my interests are quite broad. To put it simply, I am interested topics that moves me in some way, hence the title ‘Touching Research’. At the moment, the main themes in my research include loneliness, self-esteem, mental health, touch and how people deal with their mortality. These are some of the questions I’m trying to (help) answer with my research:

* How do we prevent mental health problems among vulnerable groups in society?

An estimated 38.2% of the EU population suffers from a mental disorder (Wittchen et al., 2011), and the considerable disability burden in terms of lost work days constitute a major health economic challenge (Olesen et al., 2012; Wittchen & Jacobi, 2005). Previous research has identified various personality traits that are consistently predictive of poor mental health, such as low self-esteem (e.g., Sowislo & Orth, 2013), thought suppression (e.g., Berrocal, Pennato, & Bernini, 2009), experiential avoidance (e.g., Tull, Gratz, Salters, & Roemer, 2004), alexithymia (e.g., Leweke, Keichsenring, Kruse, & Hermes, 2012) and neuroticism (e.g., Kotov, Gamex, Schmidt & Watson, 2010). However, not all people with vulnerable personality traits display poor mental health. In my research, I identified loneliness as a moderating variable that determines whether people’s latent vulnerability becomes translated into overt psychological complaints. This finding highlights the importance of interventions that reduce loneliness, which forms a significant psychological and societal burden in and of itself, in order to increase resilience against mental health problems. In this line of research, I try to explain how seemingly diverse personality traits all come to be related to the same mental health problems. Namely, by taking into account people's early attachment experiences as a child. 

* What are some powerful ways to make people feel more connected?


* How can we help people who are very anxious about their mortality? How can we help people who feel that life is meaningless?

* Are there any good substitutes for human connection?
