      <h2 id="Past_and_Current_and_Research_Interests">Past and Current and Research Interests</h2><p>My research interests primarily lie in the area of social connection and belonging. During my graduate and post-graduate studies, I was particularly interesting in the benefits of minimal forms of connection for people who feel deprived of it. This work has mostly consisted of correlational studies, experimental lab/online studies and some field studies in the Amsterdam area, as well as physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiagram (ECG). My specific research interests in this area include touch, adult attachment, loneliness, belonging, mental health, and existential concerns.</p>
<p>These interests have led me to develop broad, multidisciplinary interests. Accordingly, I have been looking to expand my research outside of the university laboratories to investigate close relationships in more ecological settings, with a particular interest in the developmental origins of emotion regulation, and co-regulation of emotion within close relationships (using ECG and EEG/NIRS hyperscanning). My research interests in this area include close relationships (e.g., parent-infant, romantic partners, close friends), attachment theory, emotional sharing, ecological data collection and methods for dyadic and longitudinal research.  </p>
<p>Eventually, I hope to apply my understanding of (social) emotion regulation within close relationships to design and evaluate interventions that strengthen the bonds between parents and children, between romantic partners, and within families and communities.</p>
