      <p>I have a background in Social &amp; Organisational Psychology as well as Cognitive Neuroscience, and currently work at the Clinical, Neuro- en Developmental Psychology Department at the VU University, The Netherlands. I consider myself an experimental psychologist with broad interests that are inherently multidisciplinary. After all, early childhood experiences build the brain architecture that forms the foundation for later health and well-being. To put it simply, my research is about issues that move me in some way, hence the title ‘Touching Research’, and my ambition is to help people deal with them by spreading information and/or providing interventions. The main themes in my research include <a href="#Loneliness_and_mental_health">loneliness and mental health</a>, <a href="#Connectedness_and_touch">connectedness and touch</a>, and <a href="#Existential_psychology_and_the_self">existential psychology and the self</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Loneliness_and_mental_health">Loneliness and mental health</h2><ul>
<li>How do we prevent mental health problems among vulnerable groups in society? What role does loneliness play?</li>
</ul>
<p>According to recent reports, a whopping 38.2% of the EU population suffers from a mental disorder (Wittchen et al., 2011). People with personality traits such as low self-esteem, thought suppression, experiential avoidance, alexithymia and neuroticism are much more likely to develop poor mental health. However, this does not necessarily have to be the case. In a series of studies, I identified loneliness as a moderating variable that determines whether people’s latent vulnerability becomes translated into overt psychological complaints. This finding further highlights the importance of loneliness interventions in order to increase resilience against mental health problems. I use attachment theory to explain why these seemingly diverse personality traits are all related to the same poor mental health outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="Connectedness_and_touch">Connectedness and touch</h2><ul>
<li>What are some powerful ways to make people feel more connected? Are there any good substitutes for human connection?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Existential_psychology_and_the_self">Existential psychology and the self</h2><ul>
<li>How can we help people who are very anxious about their mortality? How can we help people who feel that life is meaningless?</li>
</ul>
