      <p>I have a background in Social &amp; Organisational Psychology as well as Cognitive Neuroscience, and currently work at the Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology Department at the VU University, The Netherlands. I consider myself an experimental psychologist with broad interests that are inherently multidisciplinary. After all, early childhood experiences build the brain architecture that forms the foundation for later health and well-being. To put it simply, my research is about societal and psychological issues that move me in some way, hence the title ‘Touching Research’, and I am driven to help people deal with them by spreading information and/or providing interventions. The main themes in my research include <a href="#Loneliness_and_mental_health">loneliness and mental health</a>, <a href="#Belongingness_and_touch">belongingness and touch</a>, and <a href="#Existential_concerns_and_the_self">existential concerns and the self</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Loneliness_and_mental_health">Loneliness and mental health</h2><ul>
<li>How do we prevent mental health problems among vulnerable groups in society? What role does loneliness play?</li>
</ul>
<p>According to recent reports, a whopping 38.2% of the EU population suffers from a mental disorder (Wittchen et al., 2011). People with personality traits such as low self-esteem, thought suppression, experiential avoidance, alexithymia and neuroticism are much more likely to develop poor mental health. However, this does not necessarily have to be the case. In a series of studies, I identified loneliness as a moderating variable that determines whether people’s latent vulnerability becomes translated into overt psychological complaints. This finding further highlights the importance of loneliness interventions in order to increase resilience against mental illness. I use attachment theory to explain why these seemingly diverse personality traits are all related to the same poor mental health outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="Belongingness_and_touch">Belongingness and touch</h2><ul>
<li>Seeing as how feeling connected is so important for peoples’ well-being, what are some powerful ways to make vulnerable people feel like they belong? Are there any good substitutes for human connection?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many ways in which people come to feel connected and accepted, from experiencing a very minimal sense of closeness to having  intimate, meaningful relationships. People already feel a connection to others when they notice minor similarities, (Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007), and this deepens when they share subjective experiences (Pinel et al., 2006) and intimately self-disclose about difficult topics (Sedikides, 1999). Based on such findings, I develop belongingness interventions to help minority students and other lonely groups feel connected and valued.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, people do not necessarily need the presence of close others to feel connected, they may feel strongly connected simply when they are asked to think of them (Mikulincer et al., 2001). My research shows that (simulated) interpersonal touch and touching soft objects provide comfort and a sense of closeness, possibly by reminding us of early experiences with our loved ones. Interestingly, these touch experiences seem to be most helpful to people who struggle most to trust others, perhaps because these are safe ways to feel connected with minimal chances of rejection.</p>
<h2 id="Existential_concerns_and_the_self">Existential concerns and the self</h2><ul>
<li>Can we use belongingness and touch interventions to help people who are very anxious about their mortality, such as people with low self-esteem?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this line of research I investigate whether (simulated) interpersonal touch buffers against the effects of existential concerns, such as death anxiety. My colleagues and I found that touch alleviated death anxiety among people with low self-esteem, who find it very difficult to deal with their mortality. Thus, embodied touch experiences seem to be most helpful especially to those who need it most (Koole, Tjew-A-Sin &amp; Schneider, 2014; see Publications).</p>
